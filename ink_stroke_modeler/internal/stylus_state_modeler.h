// This class is used to model the state of the stylus for a given position,
// based on the state of the stylus at the original input points.
//
// The stylus is modeled by storing the last max_input_samples positions and
// states received via Update() and the velocities and accelerations calculated
// from those positions; when queried, it treats the stored positions as a
// polyline, and finds the relevant segment either by looking at the closest
// segment or by projecting in the direction of the given normal vector. The
// returned stylus state is a linear interpolation between the states associated
// with the endpoints of the segment, correcting angles to account for the
// "wraparound" that occurs at 0 and 2Ï€. The value used for interpolation is
// based on how far along the segment the closest point lies.
//
// If Update() is called with a state in which a field (i.e. pressure, tilt, or
// orientation) has a negative value (indicating no information), then the
// results of Query() will be -1 for that field until Reset() is called. This is
// tracked independently for each field; e.g., if you pass in tilt = -1, then
// pressure and orientation will continue to be interpolated normally.
